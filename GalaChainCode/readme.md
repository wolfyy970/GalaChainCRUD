## Overview

This project is built for developing, testing, and deploying smart contracts on the GalaChain blockchain. The project uses TypeScript and follows best practices for code quality and testing.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm (v7 or higher)
- Docker (Required to run the GalaChain network)
- GalaChain CLI (Ensure it is properly installed and added to your PATH)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/wolfyy970/GalaChainCRUD
   cd https://github.com/wolfyy970/GalaChainCRUD

2. Install the dependencies

    ```bash
    npm install

## project-structure

src/: Contains the implementation of the smart contracts.
e2e/: Contains end-to-end tests for the contracts.
keys/: Stores public keys for chaincode deployment.
lib/: Compiled JavaScript files from TypeScript source.
test-network/: Network configurations for GalaChain.

## scripts
Script	Description
start	Starts the GalaChain network.
clean	Cleans up the build artifacts.
build	Compiles the TypeScript code.
build:watch	Watches and compiles TypeScript code automatically.
lint	Lints the codebase using ESLint.
fix	Fixes linting issues automatically.
format	Formats the codebase using Prettier.
prepublishOnly	Runs formatting, linting, testing, and builds the project before publishing.
network:start	Starts the GalaChain network with specified contracts.
network:up	Starts the GalaChain network with a specific configuration.
network:prune	Prunes the network.
network:recreate	Recreates the GalaChain network from scratch.
test	Runs unit tests.
test:e2e	Runs end-to-end tests.
update-snapshot	Updates Jest snapshots for tests.

## chaincode-keys

The chaincode keys are used for deploying and managing smart contracts.

Location of Keys
By default, keys are generated in the keys/ directory:

Admin Key: keys/gc-admin-key.pub
Developer Key: keys/gc-dev-key.pub
Generating Keys
If the keys are not available, you can generate them using the following commands:

bash

galachain keygen gc-admin-key
galachain keygen gc-dev-key
Note: Share the developer key (gc-dev-key.pub) with all team members who will deploy the chaincode.

## Testing
The project includes unit and integration tests to ensure the reliability of the smart contracts.

Running Tests
Unit Tests:

bash

npm run test
End-to-End Tests:

bash

npm run test:e2e
Test cases are located in the e2e/ directory and focus on contract behavior and integration with the blockchain network.

## development-workflow
Write Smart Contracts: Add your contract logic in the src/ directory.
Run Tests: Write and execute test cases under e2e/ to verify functionality.
Deploy Contracts: Use the GalaChain CLI to deploy contracts using the following script:
bash

npm run network:start
Debugging: Use logs and tests to debug any issues in the network.
